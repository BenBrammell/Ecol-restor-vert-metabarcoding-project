This repository contains files utilzed for the evaluation of primers for the project,"The use of environmental DNA metabarcoding in the evaluation of vertebrate communities across urban stream restoration gradients." The performance of the MiFish and Batra primer set were tested using the program PrimerMiner (Elbrecht and Leese 2017). PrimerMiner allows in silico evaluation of primer capabilities and offers improvement over previous evaluation programs by considering the adjacency, position, and type of each mismatch between a primer and its template sequence (Elbrecht and Leese 2017). Primers were tested against a custom reference database consisting of a subset of the fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, and mammal species (MiFish = 89 species, Batra = 103 species) known to occur in the central Kentucky region.
